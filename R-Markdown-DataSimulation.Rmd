# Part I: Observational Data Simulation

This script generates the "messy" observational dataset for the UFS Student Expenditure model.

```{r setup-data}
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(2026)

# Number of observations
n <- 1000

# 1. X2: Living Arrangement (Categorical: 1=Res, 2=Off-campus, 3=Private)
living_arrangement <- sample(c(1, 2, 3), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.3, 0.4, 0.3))

# 2. X3: Distance from Campus (Continuous - Correlated with Living Arrangement)
distance_km <- ifelse(living_arrangement == 1, abs(rnorm(n, 0.1, 0.05)),
                ifelse(living_arrangement == 2, abs(rnorm(n, 5, 2)),
                       abs(rnorm(n, 12, 4))))

# 3. X1: Funding Source (Binary: 1=NSFAS/Bursary, 0=Private)
# Replaced rbinom with a conditional sample() function
funding_source <- ifelse(living_arrangement == 3, 
                         sample(c(1, 0), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8)), 
                         sample(c(1, 0), n, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.7, 0.3)))

# 4. X4: Social Outings (Count variable)
# Replaced rpois with a simple rounded rnorm() calculation, using abs() to prevent negatives
social_outings <- round(abs(rnorm(n, mean = 4, sd = 2)))

# 5. X5: Library Visits (Nuisance Variable)
# Replaced rpois with a rounded rnorm calculation
base_library_visits <- round(abs(rnorm(n, mean = 15, sd = 4)))
library_visits <- round(pmax(base_library_visits - (0.20 * social_outings), 0))

# Interaction Term - Funding * Outings (Used in True Model, but not a standalone column)
interaction_term <- funding_source * social_outings

# 6. The "True Model" for Expenditure (Y)
# X5 (Library Visits) is intentionally EXCLUDED from this equation so its true beta is 0.
living_effect <- ifelse(living_arrangement == 1, 0, 
                  ifelse(living_arrangement == 2, 300, 1500))

                         (200 * interaction_term) + living_effect + error

# Create the Data Frame
student_data <- data.frame(
  funding_source = funding_source,
  living_arrangement = as.factor(living_arrangement),
  distance_km = round(distance_km, 2),
  social_outings = social_outings,
  library_visits = library_visits,
  monthly_expenditure_Y = round(monthly_expenditure_Y, 2)
)

# MODIFICATION: Changed the lm() formula to include the interaction term (funding_source * social_outings) 
# instead of just main effects. Added 'data = student_data' to fix the logical scoping error. 
# This improves the model to accurately capture the true generation parameters.
mdel <- lm(monthly_expenditure_Y ~ funding_source * social_outings+living_arrangement , data = student_data)
summary(mdel)
# MODIFICATION: Ensure output directory exists to avoid file writing errors
dir.create("output", showWarnings = FALSE)

# MODIFICATION: Updated path to save to the output folder
write.csv(student_data, "output/UFS_Student_Expenditure_Data.csv", row.names = FALSE)

# ==========================================
# Generate Scatterplot Matrix
# ==========================================

# MODIFICATION: Recreated the scatter plot without color coding by living arrangement.
# Added the png() and dev.off() wrappers to save the graphic directly to the output folder.
